This file is the readme file for LinkWithin Mobile Downsizer

== Description ==

This plug-in just inserts a new stylesheet to shrink LinkWithin if
the device window is too small to show the minimum number of 
links for LinkWithin (3). This code drops it to 2 links. I make no 
warranties about its effectiveness but it seems to work out ok with 
the WPtouch and Jetpack plugins installed.

Hopefully the creators of LinkWithin will add mobile compatibility
in their next update.

== Installation ==

0. Have LinkWithin installed and activated. Kinda useless without that first.

1. Upload `linkwithin-mobile-downsizer.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
	 OR
   download the zip file and install manually
   
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why did I write this? =

My friends who are the genius/talent behind www.not-literally.com asked if I could help 
with their website. This is the second item on the list to get taken care to make sure
the website was mobile compatible. They let me test things out while I fix things up.

= Will I maintain this plugin? =

Not sure. Hopefully I wont have to. But since I have only been using WordPress for less 
than a week, who knows. I just got it to work and figured I would share.

= Where should we go if we need for more support? =

Check out http://www.Not-Literally.com. They have a bunch of fun stuff there to take your mind off 
your troubles. Then when your done, umm buy a t-shirt.
