LinkWithin Mobile Downsizer - renumbering links to fit on mobile devices.

== Description ==

This plugin inserts a new stylesheet to shrink LinkWithin down to 2 links instead of the preset number for small display screens. If the device window is large enough to show 3 (or more) links it will. The inserted code dynamically chooses between 2 and whatever size was chosen originally from the LinkWithin plugin page. I make no warranties about its effectiveness but it seems to work out ok with the WPtouch and Jetpack plugins installed.



== Installation ==

0. Have LinkWithin installed and activated. Kinda useless without that first.

1. Upload `linkwithin-mobile-downsizer.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
	 OR
   download the zip file and install manually
   
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Are these Frequently Asked Questions = 

No. No one but me asked these questions.

= Why did I write this? =

My friends who are the genius/talent behind www.not-literally.com asked if I could help 
with their website. This is the second item on the list to get taken care to make sure
the website was mobile compatible. They let me test things out while I fix things up.

= Will I maintain/update this plugin? =

I plan to make it 100% compatible with more than just 3 links.

= Where should we go if we need for more support? =

Check out http://www.Not-Literally.com. They have a bunch of fun stuff there to take your mind off your troubles. Then when your done, umm buy a t-shirt.

Actual support should be referenced with the creators of LinkWithin.
